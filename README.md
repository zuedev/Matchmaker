> An API-driven application for matching profiles together based on an extensible algorithm

## Abstract

This project is a proof-of-concept for a matchmaking application. It is designed to be extensible and configurable, and to be able to be used in a variety of contexts. It uses a REST-like API to communicate with the client, and a database to store the data. Discord is used as the client for this project, but it could be used with any other client that can communicate with the API.
